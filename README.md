## 📂 Projects Overview

### 🔍 1. `Book_Engine.ipynb`
A basic recommendation engine that uses simple logic or filtering to suggest books to users based on preferences or history.

### 📈 2. `Linear Regression HCC.ipynb`
Applies linear regression to predict outcomes related to Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC), demonstrating data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

### 🧠 3. `project-mnist.ipynb`
Image classification on the MNIST dataset using machine learning techniques. Includes data visualization and model accuracy evaluation.

### 📩 4. `sms_text_classification.ipynb` & `sms_text_classification.py`
A binary text classification project that identifies spam vs. ham SMS messages using NLP techniques and ML classifiers (e.g., Naive Bayes, SVM).
